Customize the spinning Loader Animation of Contact Form 7

== Description ==

For good reason the Contact Form 7 plugin is the most used contact form plugin for WordPress. The downside is that you see the same boring spinning animation on zillions of websites. The [CF7 Custom Spinner](https://petersplugins.com/free-wordpress-plugins/contact-form-7-custom-spinner/) plugin allows you to customize this loader animation!

== Usage ==

Customize the spinner animation in ‘CF7 Custom Spinner’ section of your WordPress Dashboard. That's it!

== Customization Options ==

This plugin allows you to choose from

* 12 animations
* 16 colors
* 3 sizes

(which gives a total of 576 possible combinations)

== Requirements ==

The only requirement for this plugin is that you have the Contact Form 7 plugin installed and activated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it work with the theme I'm using? =

Of course I can't guarantee that, but actually the plugin should work with every theme.

= What about Web Browser compatibility? =

This plugin uses pure CSS animations, which are supported in the latest version of all major browsers. Browsers with support for CSS animations make up about 95% of all usage worldwide. Browsers that do not support CSS animations will display the loader without animation.

= What about performance? =

The CSS code is not generated each time a page is requested but only when saving the settings, so you don't have to worry about any negative performance effects.

= What about page size? =

The plugin only adds some CSS code. It does not use images. It does not generate additional server requests. The size of the CSS code depends on the complexity of the anmiation. The most complex animation generates additional CSS code of about 3 KB. Nothing to worry about.

= Is it possible to prevent the CSS code from being loaded on pages where it is not needed? =

The CSS code generated by the Contact Form 7 Custom Spinner plugin automatically is not added to a page on which you prevented the Contact Form 7 stylesheet from being loaded. You don't have to care about this.

= Where can I get help? =
